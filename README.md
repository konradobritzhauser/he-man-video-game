## Description  
Thrilled to put my programming skills to the test, for my first published javascript project I wrote this thrilling, fast-paced and meme-inspired video game that will push ones reflexes to the next level. 



Ride the rainbow and survive as He-man using the powers of music,gems,lasers and dance to defeat the evil skeletor. 

This was all done using node.js without any imported libraries.

## How To Play
To Get Started Click on this link:

The goal is simple, to survive through countless increasingly difficult waves of enemies and obtain the highest score possible. The gameplay involves dodging enemies, shooting lasers, maintaining your combo, managing your health and mana, and collecting gems for unbelievable powerups. 

Use the arrow keys to move up,left,down and right. The space bar to shoot lasers. Lasers cost mana so make sure to keep it replenished by collecting green gems. Each enemy that hits you takes one heart. Lose all your hearts and it is game over. Collect red gems to heal yourself. Red and green gems are fairly common, but what will really make your score and experience skyrocket and truly surf the rainbow with style are the purple stars. Upon collecting He-man will explode into dance in a powered-up mode for 8 seconds. When powered-up your health and mana will recharge to full and enemies you touch will be destroyed(no need to waste lasers during this time). Collecting as many of these as possible is the quickest way to increase your combo and multiply your score. 

Another mechanic of the game is the combo meter. Every enemy killed will increase your combo by one. For every combo you have, points you gain are multiplied by that amount. So if an enemy kill gives 1000 points at 0x combo, at 100x it will give 100,000. However one must be very careful, for if He-man makes the wrong move and takes damange, he will lose his rhythm and all his combo points. Reach a high combo meter to get special upgrades. As the game progresses, it will get harder so be sure to grab these upgrades as soon as you can.

If you want to restart the game, simply refresh the page.

That's about it! enjoy :)
